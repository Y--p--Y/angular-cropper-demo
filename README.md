# Another AngularJS Cropper

This project comes is a demo of image cropper which is basically about click and drag on a canvas. What makes it different is it can crop multiple images from a single one.

This is also my first time to try Yeoman + AngularJS 1 + es6 + Webpack + Jasmine.

To play with it, start by `gulp serve` then visit `localhost:3000`
